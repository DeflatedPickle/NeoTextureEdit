Currently working on:
 - Zoom
    - fix: zoom to mouse cursor
    - fix: make zoomed rendering faster
 - Curve class and CurveParam class (for HDR output node)

 - Caching System:
    - implement a Debug view that shows the accesses and current cache elements (especially to
      find memory leaks)
      

Feature Requests:

  - Enable/Disable GUI Antialiasing Option
  - Zoom,
  - Export All Menu Item
  - Anisotropic Blur Node
  - UnDo stack
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  
  
TODO:  

- FIX: the problem with the emboss node and zoom (export does not look like Zoom!)

- Implement Interface public InputStream findData(String dataPath); inside the texture graph loader and bitmap
  loader that can be replaced by some other loader (default loader uses file system; some other may use another
  method).
  
- Not all nodes are using the caching system (for example the transform node or parts of the warp node); we
  need to evaluate how interpolated access could help improving the performance of these nodes
- Fix the border in the caching system

- Export All button

- Change the file format to an XML format



Current Keyboard Shortcuts:
 - Ctrl-click on gradient editor nodes moves all
 - Ctrl-click drags the desktop
 - Dragging nodes: Ctrl-drag on target node connector connects to all nodes
 - Alpha: Ctrl-drag on color gradient editor moves all nodes
 - Spectral Control: Ctrl-Click leads to continous update of noise 
  
  
Caching System and Derivative based nodes:
  Idea: - perhaps store the derivative also in the cache buffer next to the color data
          better: provide an extra cache access function for derivatives
        - for warp, emboss, normal map try: use the non-cache evaluation for the warped texture
        - make the cache tileable (and the tile size configurable)
        

Refactoring:
  - the package names are from a legacy project and need adjustment to better reflect the current
    structure
    

FIXME: don't remove the glpreview string in the texture graph files when gl preview is disabled/could not be loaded on graph save
    

Export Settings:
	The current solution for export is to specify export in each
	channel individually; this may be not the most efficient solution
	Building an extra export node might be better but need to get some more
	experience what is actually needed. (For example the export path should not
	be hardcoded in each export node)

General:
 - Make the Help-System using nice font and backgrounds and write a base dialog class for displaying such messages
 
 - Make the parameter of a network accessible through commandline; this allows for simple animations 
 
 - Image Output Node (on change or on button press) writes out an image (can be used to store destination paths)
   perhaps I want also to put the channel combiner in here (use 4 inputs and select the combination for the output image)
  
 - Make the "Drag All" feature in the gradient editor more robust

 - Special Color for bitmap pattern nodes in graph editor

 - More Features needed in lighting node: ambient and diffuse lighting, highlight color, ...
 
 - Higher order Interpolation in Gradient Editor (Hermite, ...)
  

OpenGL Preview
 - Add a scrollbar to the parameter editor of the GL Preview (?)
 - Encapsulate glsl uniform parameters and location code into class for easy adding/removing of shader parameters
 - Load the preview objects from external data or generate them procedurally

Feature Requests:
 
 
Known Bugs:
  - Check output of the kd-tree (in the cellular pattern) for non-euclidean distances (it should be wrong)
  - Repaint of GLCanvas sloppy (without thread it disappears sometimes; with thread it flickers unnecessarily)


Planned Features:
 - Tiled Export (for very large exported images)
 - GLSL Export 
 - FFT-Node
 - HDR OutputNode + Curve Editor
 - Auto Graph Layout
 - Loading and/or Editing of GL Shaders for Preview
 - Export Format Specifier (How to group channels in export images; postfix for filenames)
 - Multi-Core support for texture evaluation (especially for export)
 - DXTC export
 - ?? loading of own objects ??

Done:
 - Add a transform Node
 - Loading of Bitmap files as input nodes
 - Move to new LWJGL Version 2.3
 - Add preview objects with tangents (probably best to export them as vertex array)
 - Add more preview objects
 - Scaling of u/v coords for preview
 - Interpolation Modes for Bitmap Node (at least bi-linear)
 - Lighting Filter (with Normal Map input)
 - Preview Node Zoom (showing a region of the texture (info should contain target resolution); 
   create a simple (self-managed) internal frame that can be moved, closed and with zoom controls
